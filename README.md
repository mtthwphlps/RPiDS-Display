#RPiDS-Display
Open-Source Digital Signage System

**UNDER DEVELOPMENT!!! DO NOT USE IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT!**

##Display Server
Like the Cache Server, this part of the RPiDS system lives on any server that supports PHP and MySQL, except that we also need a graphical interface. RPiDS runs in any HTML5/CSS3 compatible browser. Something like a Raspberry Pi is recommended, auto-launching Chromium in kiosk mode.
